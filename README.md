# fullstack-tech-challenge
Welcome to Tom's (very informal) Tech Challenge for a full-stack intern role.
Please follow this guide, complete the challenges and discuss your code during 30min interview.

## Prerequisites (local)
- https://git-scm.com/
- https://code.visualstudio.com/
- https://www.docker.com/

## Prerequisites (codebases)
- Clone into GitHub codebases and run from there

## Codebase and stack
- typescript
- next.js & react
- PostgreSQL

## Challenges
1. Fork this repository to your GitHub account.
2. Please install prerequisites and clone repositories.
3. Build something interesting (see ideas below) starting from this repository.
4. Share the codebase with me and we can chat about it during the interview.

### Ideas
- Design a simple TODO App or similar with CRUD API and prisma (https://www.prisma.io/docs/getting-started/setup-prisma/start-from-scratch/relational-databases-typescript-postgres) (start from `npx prisma init stage`)
- Creatively integrate a three.js scene using `react-three-fiber` (https://docs.pmnd.rs/react-three-fiber/getting-started/introduction)
- Create a dashboard styled with `tailwindcss` and show third-party API data (https://openweathermap.org).
- Anything else interesting from a domain you are familiar with and would like to build and talk about!

### Hints
- Good knowledge of what you've built and how it works!
- Clean and tidy code.
- Not writing huge amounts of code (but please retain readability).

### Next.js notes

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

- Build and reopen in devcontainer or open codespace

```shell
yarn
yarn dev
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result (or codespace forwarded URL)

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.
